## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and variables
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- Chrome developer tools to inspect responsive design


### What I learned

I Estimated 2 hours 30 minutes total work time. I came fairly close! I was able to finish the design after 2 hours and 39 minutes. I'm pretty happy with how close my estimate was to the actual time it took me!

I had some alignment issues with the little icons in the Summary section. I thought flex was being applied to them and they weren't aligning properly. It turns out that my selector wasn't right and I wasn't applying anything to those elements. It's good to be aware of all the spots you can have problems so you can debug efficiently. 


### Continued development

I'm sure that the HTML is an accessibility nightmare, so I'm going to take some time to read accessibility documentation and edit the HTML. I'll update this when I do.
